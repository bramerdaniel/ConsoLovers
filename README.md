## ConsoLovers.ConsoleToolkit.Core and ConsoLovers.ConsoleToolkit
The ConsoLovers.ConsoleToolkit is a collection of several independant tools that can be used to write console applications (better and faster).

Check out he [Wiki](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/wiki) for detailed support of the most features.

### Main features are:
* A [ConsoleMenu](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/wiki/ConsoleMenu) that supports Keyboard and Mouse selection.
  The menu is extremely customizable, supports color themes, index navigation and much more...
* A CommandLineEngine that offers parsing of command line arguments and mapping them to properties of a class 
* A [InputBox](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/wiki/InputBox) class that can be used for password scenarios.
* The [ConsoleApplicationManager](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/wiki/ConsoleApplicationManager) and the [ConsoleApplication](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/wiki/ConsoleApplication). A base class for console applications to get rid of the static context, normal console application is runnin in.
